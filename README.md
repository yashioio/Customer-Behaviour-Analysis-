📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Insights
🔎 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — starting from raw data loading in Python to building an interactive Power BI dashboard and presenting insights through a professional PPT report.

The objective of this project is to extract meaningful business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present them in a clear, data-driven manner suitable for decision-making.
